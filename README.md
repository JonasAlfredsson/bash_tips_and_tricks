# bash_tips_and_tricks

I don't write Bash code that often, so when I need to do it I usually have to
Google the same stuff every time because I cannot remember exactly how it should
be done. So in order to reduce the time wasted on remembering what search term
I used the last time I found the best guide I will just collect them here (with
links back to the source of course).

I think I will keep everything in a single document so it will be easier to
`Ctrl+F` stuff.
